# Homework React Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. React exercises
3. Optional: Practice exercises
4. Code along
5. PROJECT: Ecommerce Shop I
6. Optional: Challenges

## **1. Practice the concepts**

Let's get started with some interactive exercises! Complete the exercises from the following resources:

- [Scotch.io: React challenges. Exercises 1-6](https://scotch.io/courses/10-react-challenges-beginner)

## **2. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `React` fork, go to the folder `week1`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

If you are struggling with the prep exercises, try out some of the practice exercises, maybe they will give you some ideas!

## **3. Optional: Practice exercises**

Practice, practice, practice! Watching videos is a good way to get new ideas, but to cement them into your mind you need to program a lot. What you build is up to you as long as you keep challenging yourself. We have provided some practice exercises to help you if you don't know what to build.

Inside of your `React` fork, go to the folder `week1`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/practice-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. Go through them to practice concepts that you have learned about!

## **4. Code along**

> Create a new GitHub repository for this project.

Learning how to work with React is a fundamentally different approach to building a user interface. Therefore, we need to practice a lot!

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to build a `Budget Calculator`!

It might seem complicated at first, but don't worry. Aim for understanding the principle behind it to the best you can. If you ever feel in doubt: do a Google search or ask a question in Slack!

Enjoy!

## **5. PROJECT: Ecommerce Shop I**

During this module you'll be starting a project called `Ecommerce Shop`! Like in the Node.js module, each week you'll add to it until it becomes a fully-fledged application that has used all of the concepts you have learned.

Here's what you're eventually going to end up with: [Ecommerce Shop Finished](https://jolly-curie-a12f0d.netlify.app/)

Have a look at the [project/README.md](./project/README.md) file to know what to do this week.

## **6. Optional: Challenges**

Our friends over at CodeYourFuture have provided a repository with different ideas for [challenges to build](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges). Have a look at the `README.md` in each folder to see what the challenge is and try to build it. It mentions the difficulty in the different README's, anything with easy should be doable at this point. But if not, leave it for next week and then try again.

Building many different small applications will get you the practice you need to do your final project in week 4, so in the next 3 weeks if you are done with the rest of the homework, look back at the challenges and try to do as many as you can.

## **SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!**

After you've finished your list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to the HackYourHomework repository (which in this case is the [React](https://www.github.com/HackYourHomework/React) repository) using GIT.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. Project: Hack Your Weather I

Make sure you _only_ commit the project files to the repository!

_Deadline Tuesday 23.59 CET_

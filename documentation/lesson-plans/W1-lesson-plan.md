# Lesson Plan Week 1

The purpose of this class is to introduce the student to some basic React concepts:

- Thinking in React
- How to write reusable components and why
- The purpose of JSX
- What are props and how to pass them down components
- Most important: React is just a simple library/script that allows you to make dynamic, modern user interfaces

## Agenda

## Core concepts

1. Thinking in React

- Any given page can be broken up into reusable components
- Component hierarchy

2. Components

- Reusable blocks of JavaScript & HTML
- Each component instance can be given different data
- Can display JavaScript values in the HTML, using the { } symbols
- Class component vs. functional component

3. JSX

- A way to write dynamic HTML code with JavaScript
- It is a more intuitive version of the function `createElement()`
- A component should always return JSX
- These are the parts that will build the DOM structure

4. Props

- Props is short for property (like a regular HTML attribute)
- It is (dynamic) data that can be given to child components
- Passed down using an identifier, a self-defined attribute name
- Can be given to multiple instances of components

## Build with students

Ask each student to follow along. You'll be leading the first exercise and showing them how it's done and explaining your thought process along the way. In the second exercise the student needs to work on it themselves.

1. A navigation bar

- Show how to divide an element into components
- Reuse components
- Pass down props

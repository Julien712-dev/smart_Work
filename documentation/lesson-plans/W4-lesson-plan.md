# Lesson Plan Week 4

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is help the student refresh and apply the `concept of routing to the client-side`, to fully make use of the power of a SPA.

## Core Concepts

1. Server-side routing

- Routing refresher: the mechanism by which `requests` (as specified by a URL change or HTTP method) are `send to an endpoint on the server`, that then executes code that handles the request.
- Server-side routing happens `when the client sends a request to the server`, usually **triggered by a URL change**

**NOT FINISHED**

2. Client-side routing

- Server-side routing is the norm, but with rise of modern JavaScript and SPAs came **client-side routing**
- On URL change **no request to server** (and thus no page refresh), **only changed state of app and URL adjustment**
- For React, third-party library **React-Router** is most popular
- Most important concepts: `<BrowserRouter />`, `<Route />`, `<Link />`, `<Switch />`, the `location` prop and `history` object

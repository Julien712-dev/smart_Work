# Homework Week 1

Fork this repository and base your week 1 homework on the skeleton [todo-app](../todo-app).

When you are done issue a PR with your homework as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan.

## Outline

Render a basic todo list with three items:

```
Todo List

* Get out of bed
* Brush teeth
* Eat breakfast
```

Mark it so that the first one is done and second and third not done yet. Before you start draw a mockup and identify
the components with colours. You have to use more than two components. Think which props the components should take.

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Correct functionality
- Code organisation
- Cleanliness of code

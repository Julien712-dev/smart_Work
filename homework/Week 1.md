# Homework Week 1

## Outline

Create a basic to-do-list app, based on an internal state.

## Details

Given an application state like this:

```
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "description": "<Description>",
      "done":        true / false
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Create a React-based app that will list all todos.

## Features

1. The app should list all todos.
2. The app should feature an "Add" button to add a new todo. For now, use the JavaScript `prompt` function to ask the user for a description.
3. Each todo item should be removable.
4. If you get around to it: create a checkbox in each to do to mark the item as done.

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Correct functionality
- Code organisation
- Proper metadata (React prop types)
- Cleanliness of code

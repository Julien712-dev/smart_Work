# Homework Week 2

## Outline

Extend your to-do list app with editing capabilities.

## Details

Continue your to-do list app from week 1. Extend the app so that people can enter descriptions without having to use the `prompt` function, and allow users to edit the descriptions of existing to-do items.

## Features

1. If you didn't do this in week 1: create a checkbox in each to do to mark the item as done.
2. When pressing the "Add" button, instead of using `prompt`, there should be a nice editor.
3. Users should be able to edit existing to-do items

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Correct functionality
- Code organisation
- Proper metadata (React prop types)
- Cleanliness of code

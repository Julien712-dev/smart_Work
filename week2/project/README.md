# Ecommerce Project II

## 1. Setup

Make sure you created a new week2 branch from the `main` branch of your forked repo. Then copy over the `ecommerce` folder you made last week into the `week2/project` folder. That way any feedback you get for week1 can be changed in the week1 branch and you are free to refactor this week as you see fit. This does mean you may need to apply the same changes to multiple branches, but let's say that that is good for the learning process :).

## 2. Requirements

We are going to focus on linking up our app to the API this week. By the end of the assignment your application should work similar to this:

_Note: The API is a fully open API so can be a little slow to respond sometimes. Great for checking your loading UX!_

What you need to have done at the end of the week:

- The fake-data directory should not be a part of your project anymore
- Your app will need to make 2 queries to the following endpoints:
  - `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/categories` -> To get all the categories
  - `https://fakestoreapi.com/products` or `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/<selectedCategory>` -> To get the products. The API needs to do the filtering, not the frontend. Usually the amount of products will be too large to do the filtering on the frontend.
- Your app needs to show that it is loading when waiting on the request to come back. You can test this by mimicing a slow connection in your browsers' developer tools
- Your app needs to show an error message if the request failed

# Homework React Week 3

## **Todo list**

1. Prep exercises
2. Code alongs
3. PROJECT: Ecommerce Shop III
4. Optional: Test Exercises
5. Optional: Challenges

## **1. Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `React` fork, go to the folder `week3`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/prep-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## **2. Code alongs**

> Create a new GitHub repository for each of these projects.

### 2.1 Expense tracker using the Context API

In the following tutorial you'll learn how to build an `Expense Tracker`. You'll do so using React Hooks, but also using the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)!

Happy learning!

### 2.2 Video player using react-router-dom

In this code along you'll learn how to make a cool Video Player! You'll do so using various packages, among those are [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) and [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).

The first is a third party library that'll make writing CSS rules easier in React applications. And it's also starting to be used in more and more real life applications! The second is the most used package for handling client-side routing.

Enjoy!

## **3. Ecommerce Shop III**

Let's continue building on our application! This week you'll use all the new tricks you learned to finish up the ecommerce shop by adding client-side routing, a context to store the user's favourite items and finally clean up some duplicate code by building our own custom hook!

Have a look at the [project/README.md](./project/README.md) file to know what to do this week.

## **4. Optional: Test exercises**

To practice your `react-testing-library` skills we have some extra small exercises that isolate testing all of the different things that you have learned the past weeks! In the `test-exercises` folder you will find a react application with some test files. The `README.md` that explains what the idea is.

> If you are feeling up for an extra challenge you can try adding tests to your project! If you are struggling with the complexity of the tests you may need to split your components a bit. Note: this is an optional extra challenge and is not required.

## **5. Optional: Challenges**

Remember that our friends over at CodeYourFuture have provided a repository with different ideas for [challenges to build](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-react-challenges). Have a look at the `README.md` in each folder to see what the challenge is and now you can also do ones that require you to create multiple pages!

## **SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!**

After you've finished your list it's time to show us what you got! Upload all your files to a forked repository (a copy from the original, which in this case is the [React](https://www.github.com/HackYourHomework/React) repository) using GIT.

If you need a refresher, take a look at the following [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how it's done.

The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

## Week goals

This week we are going to look at some more advanced topics. Let's start with looking at routing. Because we build single page applications in React, the location in the address bar has no effect on what we should show. When building more advanced applications that becomes a problem, as we want to be able to define different pages. To solve this we use what is called client-side routing, have a look [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/react/routing.md).

As you can see in the router library, they have built their own hooks. We can do that too and it is extremely powerful. Have a look at the custom hook section [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/react/custom-hooks.md) to see how to do it.

These are complex topics, so play around with this new knowledge in your own applications!

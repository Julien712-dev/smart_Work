# Week 4

In the final week of React you will put everything you have learned into practice and build the app of your dreams! As this is a big thing one of the mentors for this module will be there to help you think your app through. They will not be allowed to write any code for you however.

This project will be a great thing to put on your CV so make it look good and be something that you will enjoy working on later to keep improving. Also make sure you challenge yourself, you have a mentor to guide you if you get stuck! This means you will learn more if you go out of your comfort zone a little.

## Project requirements
We want you to get excited and be free to build something you are passionate about, but there are some things that we need to see you have mastered. This means there are a few requirements:

- The app needs to have multiple pages and use client-side routing
- The app should make use of the Context API
- You can either use an API that you have built or access to (then just include the backend code in the project) or should use data from a public API. _You will not be graded on backend code_

## Planning and deadlines
There are only 2 deadlines in the project, how you divide your time for the rest is up to you.

### Deadline 1: Project definition
By *Thursday 18:00PM CET* (but the earlier the better) you should send a short description of what your app will be to your project mentor. This description should make it clear that your application will adhere to the requirements. It is best to divide it into `must have` parts (that fulfil the requirements and will be built first) and `nice to have` parts (features you can add on later to make your app cooler). The reason to make this division is to make sure that you will prioritise your work correctly as you will probably run into time issues. A week is not a lot for building an application and in the end we will only be able to evaluate based on what is working.

### Deadline 2: Application
By *Tuesday 23:59PM CET* you should send a link to your github project to the Education Director. Make sure that everything works for them! The best way to test this is to clone your repository to a new directory on your computer and try to run it there.

## Grading
After finishing the project you will get another technical interview about your own project (similar to what you had in the [Browsers module](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Browsers/blob/main/PROJECT.md#the-interview)) to determine if you can go on to the project. Keep track of your class channel to see when these will be.

The difficulty of the application affects the grading in two ways:
- You get extra points for creating a difficult application (things like making your own hooks, good state management, loads of features, etc)
- We will expect simpler applications to have better structured code and be more lenient on complexer applications

## F.A.Q.

### What API's can I use?
Any API you want, you can look at the [Ideas](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/Week3/README.md) in the Using API's module to get some ideas and see what to look out for.

### Can I use third party libraries?
Yes! But please check with your mentor if you decide to use one. We don't want you to use a library that abstracts away some of the things we want to teach you.

Any UI toolkit (things like [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) that give you some basic components that have a particular style) is fine. The libaries we used during the curriculum is also fine. For the rest please let us know what you are planning.
